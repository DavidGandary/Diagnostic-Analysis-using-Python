Diagnostic analysis and presenting key insights to address problem faced by NHS( in depth technical report can be found in [01 Project Management](01%20Project%20Management/)

## Project description
The project's goal was to assess how best to allocate budgets with an overall question of whether the NHS should expand its capacity or make better utilisation of available resources.The two initial questions that have been asked by the NHS are:

- Has there been adequate staff and capacity in the networks?
- What was the actual utilisation of resources?

## Data Sources(s)
Provided was five data files, actual_duration.csv,appointments_regional.csv,national_categories.xlsx,metadata_nhs.txt and tweets.csv
## Research questions
Analysis focused on asking several questions both of key stakeholders as well as the data: 
- What is the number of locations, service settings, context types, national categories, and appointment statuses in the data sets?
- What is the date range of the provided data sets, and which service settings reported the most appointments for a specific period?
- What is the number of appointments and records per month?
- What monthly and seasonal trends are evident, based on the number of appointments for service settings, context types, and national categories?
- What are the top trending hashtags (#) on the supplied Twitter data set and how can this be used in the decision-making process?
- Was there adequate staff and capacity in the networks?
- What was the actual utilisation of resources?
- What insights can be gained by looking at missed appointments?
- What insights can be gained from the data, and what recommendations can be made to the NHS based on these insights?
